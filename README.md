Our project aims to produce an educational tool describing, in a clear visual presentation, the process by which respiratory infections, and in particular Covid-19, spread through the population. We are working on a paper in which we will present the underlying mathematical models and assumptions for review by epidemiologists and other professionals in the field. Our ultimate goal is to provide an educational model deliverable through mass media websites.

We have based our model on the superspreading hypothesis; the assumption the virus spreads most widely through stochastic events, primarily the collision of a high volume shedder with a group of vulnerable persons in a physical or social environment conducive to spread. Our project is inspired by the information presented in the article by Zeynep Tufekci in Atlantic Monthly:
